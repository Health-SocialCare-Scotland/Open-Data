# Open-Data

Example scripts and resources for interacting with open data from the [Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/) platform via API in R and python. 

Open Data functions in the [phsopendata](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsopendata) package can also be used to download resources and datasets from the open data portal. 

Extensive documentation of the CKAN API is available in the [CKAN docs](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/).
